    <h1 class="info-title">About Me.</h1>
    <p class="info-text">Hello! My name is Kaira. My interest in art started a long time ago after I started researching about Renaissance period art. From that day, I started to work on art by myself and I self-taught with hard work. Now I do art for fun and maybe
      one day I want to make it a career.</p>

  <h1 class="image-title">Anastasia-1783</h1>
  <p class="image-info">A portrait I drew inspired by the song Le Portrait. In the song, it is said that a child whose mother died, drew his mother on the parquet floor looking at the portrait of his mother given to him and lay next to her. Influenced by this part, I imagined what the child's portrait might look like, and such a portrait came out.</p>
